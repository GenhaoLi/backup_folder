# Folder Backup Script
This script continuously backs up the contents of a source folder to a destination folder at specified intervals.

## Usage

1. update var `src_folder` and `dest_folder` in `backup.py` for your source and destination folders respectively.
2. Run the script using `python backup.py`.

For now, it does not rely on any external libraries, so no need to install any dependencies.
